You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /media/ihtishamkhattak/dc9e13b9-21f1-46ce-89f8-90d9cac056f3/JAutos_Site

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are currently outside your home directory

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
